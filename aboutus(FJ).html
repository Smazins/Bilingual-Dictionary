		<h1>About us</h1>

		<p>  This project is the outcome of a research grant received from the A.S. Hornby Dictionary Research Awards (ASHDRA) scheme in 2022. The Hornby Trust is funded by the royalties obtained by the sale of Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary and related products <a href="https://www.hornby-trust.org.uk">A S Hornby Educational Trust.</a> A pilot project aimed at developing a bilingual mobile dictionary app on Atomic and Quantum Physics, this small-scale project, based on corpus-based methodologies, lays the groundwork for more extended research projects in a range of disciplines. Since there is little discipline-specific language support currently offered to undergraduate students with an Arabic first language background, this work holds great potential for undergraduates in Oman as well as in other parts of the world, including international students at Western universities. <br>
	The Research Team members acknowledge the support of Middle East College, Oman and the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, Oman for their support. We hope to continue to contribute towards achieving international standards of excellence for the higher education sector in Oman. <br>
	This chapter is part of a handbook prepared by Dr Senthilkumar, R.D. <br>
