					<p id="data1"> In the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was generally accepted that matter was composed of small indivisible particles called atoms. However, by the end of the nineteenth century, J.J. Thomson’s discovery of the first <a href="30.html"> subatomic particle</a> called <a href="31.html"> electron</a> in 1897 proved that atoms were divisible.  Since electrons are negatively charged particles and the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, it became clear that the atom must also contain positively charged material to balance the negative charge of the electrons.  This idea was confirmed by the discovery of positive rays. To account for the experimentally observed spectroscopic data at that time, several theories have been proposed regarding the structure of the atoms, which are referred to as <a href="3.html">atomic models.</a>  </p>

					<p>In this chapter, we shall discuss the Bohr model of atom, which is on the basis of <a href="23.html">quantum theory</a> of radiation. </p>
					<p id="head2"><strong>1.1.1 History of the Atomic models </strong></p>
					<p id="data2">In 1904, J.J. Thomson proposed the first model of the atom which describes the atom as a heavy sphere about 10<sup>-10</sup> m in diameter with the electrons and positive particles uniformly distributed within it.  As this model failed to explain the results of the alpha-scattering experiment, a new model of atom was introduced by Rutherford in 1911.  According to this model, the atom is a sphere and its positive charge is only located at its centre. The central core of the atom is called <a href="34.html">nucleus</a> and it is surrounded by a cloud of electrons which makes the atom electrically neutral. Since this model also failed to explain the stability of the atom as a whole and the distribution of electrons around the nucleus, Bohr, who was a student of Rutherford, introduced a new model.</p>
					<p id="head1b"><strong>1.1.2 Bohr’s Model of the Atom</strong> </p>
					<p id="data2">Niels Bohr introduced a new model of the atom, known as the Bohr atomic model in 1913.   In atomic physics, the Bohr model depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by waves of electrons in <a href="1.html">orbits</a> – similar in structure to the solar system, but with electrostatic forces providing attraction and with waves spread over the orbit. </p>
					<p id="data2">
						The Bohr model is a primitive model of the hydrogen atom, which failed to explain the fine structure of the hydrogen atom and the structure of heavy atoms. However, due to its simplicity, the Bohr model is still commonly taught to students as an introduction to quantum mechanics.
					</p>
					<p id="data2">Bohr developed his theory of atomic structure based on Rutherford’s model and came up with the following hypotheses.  </p>
					<p>
						<li id="list1c">The atom is a sphere and has a positively charged particle in its centre called the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“nucleus”. </li>
						<li id="list1c">Electrons revolve around the nucleus in their allowed circular orbits.</li>
						<li id="list1c">Electrons do not absorb or emit energy as long as they remain in their allowed orbits. </li>
						<li id="list1c">When the electrons jump from one allowed orbit to another, they absorb or emit <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy. </li>

						The arrangement of electrons in an atom is called <a href="5.html">Electronic Configuration</a>. It helps us determine the chemical properties of atoms. The electrons in an atom occupy a series of orbits arranged around the nucleus, similar to the layers of an onion. Since each orbit has energy, it is also known as the <a href="36.html">energy level</a> of the atom. As the energy of the first orbit that is closer to the nucleus is less, it is called the lower energy level , while the orbit farther away from the nucleus is called the higher energy level as it has more energy. Orbits may contain sub-orbits and these sub-orbits have a number of orbitals which hold the electrons.

						<strong class="head3">1.2.1 Arrangement of Electrons in Orbits</strong><br /><br />
						The arrangement of electrons in atoms relates to the field of science known as quantum theory. According to quantum theory, each orbit in an atom is described by a number, known as the principal quantum number (n), which provides information about the size of the orbit.  The value of n ranges from n = 1 (the first orbit from the nucleus) to n = &#8734;(infinity).<br>

						Quantum theory also states that each orbit may contain a number of sub-orbits. Each orbit can have ‘n’ sub-orbits, where ‘n’ is the principle quantum number of the orbit. Sub-orbits are described by the letters s, p, d, f, g, and so on.  Calculations show that every orbit has an ‘s’ sub-orbit, all the orbits except the first orbit have a ‘p’ sub-orbit, all the orbits except the first and second orbits have a ‘d’ sub-orbit, and so on. These can be represented as follows:<br>

						An orbital (also called <a href="2.html">atomic orbital</a>) is a space that can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons. Each type of sub-orbit holds different orbitals, and therefore, a different number of electrons. The s sub-orbit has one orbital, which can hold up to two electrons. The  p sub-orbit has three orbitals, each of which can hold 2 electrons, for a total of 6. The d sub-orbit has 5 orbitals, for a possible total of 10 electrons. The f sub-orbit, with 7 orbitals, can hold up to 14 electrons. The information about the sub-orbits and their orbitals are summarized in Table 1.2.<br>

						The number of orbitals in an energy level (orbit) can be calculated by using the formula n<sup>2</sup>, where ‘n’ is the number of the orbit.  For example, the third energy level (n=3) has a total of 3<sup>2</sup>, or nine orbitals.  This makes sense because we know that the third energy level would have 3 sublevels: s sublevel with one orbital, p sublevel with 3 orbitals and d sublevel with 5 orbitals.

						<strong id="head1">1.3 QUANTUM PHYSICS</strong><br /><br />
						&emsp;&emsp;The classical theory of physics, which was introduced before the nineteenth century, successfully explained the motion of the macro-objects that are either observable directly or with instruments like a normal microscope.  When the classical concepts were applied to particles like electrons, <a href="32.html">protons</a>, <a href="33.html">neutrons</a>, and other subatomic particles, they failed to describe their actual behaviour.  Thus, the classical concepts cannot be applied to atomic phenomena such as the motion of an electron in an atom.  To study and understand the behaviour of atomic particles, Max Planck proposed the theory called Quantum Theory in the 19th century.  Hence, quantum theory, also called quantum mechanics, is a branch of physics which deals with the study of micro particles.<br>

						<strong>1.3.1 Planck’s Quantum Theory  </strong><br /><br />
						In 1901, Max Planck in 1901 proposed the quantum theory to explain the <a href="22.html">black body radiations</a> .  According to this theory, matter is composed of many oscillating particles which vibrate with different frequencies. The energy of oscillating particles is quantized, i.e., the oscillating particle can only have the energies as given by, <br>

In this theory, it is assumed that the vibrating particle does not radiate energy continuously but discontinuously in terms of discrete amounts called quanta or photon.  So if the particle remains in one of the quantized states, it neither emits nor absorbs any energy.  When the particle moves from one to another quantized state, it emits or absorbs energy.<br /><br />

 						<strong>1.3.3.1 Coherent Scattering</strong><br /><br />
 						&emsp;&emsp;In this type of scattering, the wavelength of the scattered X-rays is not changed, but it deviates in the direction with the incident beam. It is also called Thomson Scattering. <br /><br />
	 					<strong>1.3.3.2 Incoherent Scattering</strong><br /><br />
	 					In this type of scattering, the wavelength of the scattered X-rays is slightly changed along with the deviation in the direction of the beam. It is also called Compton Scattering. <br /><br />
	 					<strong>1.3.3.3 Compton effect</strong><br /><br />

						 <strong>Explanation of Compton Effect:</strong><br /><br />
						 &emsp;&emsp;This effect was first demonstrated in 1923 based on quantum theory of radiation by Arthur Holly Compton, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1927.<br /><br />
						 &emsp;&emsp;The entire process in the Compton Effect is treated as a particle <a href="27.html">collision</a> event between an X-ray photon and a loosely bound electron of the material.  In this process, both momentum and  energy are conserved. During this collision, a small amount of   energy from the X-ray photon is transferred to the electron of the   material.  As a result, the X-ray proceeds with less energy than the original, and therefore has a higher wavelength or lower frequency.
						 <br /><br />
						 &emsp;&emsp;The incident photon with wavelength &#955;i (energy hv and momentum hv/c) strikes an electron at rest.  The initial momentum of the electron is zero and its initial energy is only the rest mass energy, m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>.  The <a href="8.html">scattered photon</a> of wavelength &#955;<sub>s</sub> (energy hv’ and momentum hv’/c) moves off in a direction inclined at an angle ‘&#952;’ to the original direction.  The electron gains a momentum ‘mv’ and moves at an angle ‘&#8709;’ to the original direction.  Thus, based on the quantum theory, Compton derived the equation for the change in wavelength as

						&emsp;&emsp;In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes are made up of zinc. When illuminated with ultraviolet light, electrodes create electric sparks more easily. This was due to the emission of electrons from zinc.  After this phenomenon was verified by many physicists, it was discovered that alkali metals like lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium eject electrons when visible light falls on them.<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;The emission of electrons from a metal plate when illuminated by light or any other radiation of suitable frequency or wavelength is called <a href="14.html">photoelectric effect</a>. The emitted electrons are called <a href="16.html">photoelectrons</a>.<br>

						<strong>a. The effect of potential difference:</strong><br /><br />
						&emsp;&emsp;A simple experimental arrangement to study the photoelectric effect is shown in Figure 1.8. The apparatus consists of two photosensitive metal plates: A, connected to the negative terminal of a potential divider, and B which is connected to the positive terminal through galvanometer/micro-ammeter in an evacuated quartz bulb.  In the absence of e.m. radiation, there is no flow of current and hence there is no deflection in the galvanometer.  If monochromatic light is allowed to fall on the plate A, a current start flowing in the circuit which can be seen by the deflection in the 	galvanometer.<br /><br />
						When the positive potential of plate B is increased, photoelectric current is also increased.  However, if the positive potential is further increased, the photoelectric current reaches a certain maximum value which is known as <a href="18.html">saturation current</a>.<br /><br />
						If the potential of plate B is made negative, the <a href="17.html">photocurrent</a> does not immediately drop to zero but flows in the same direction as for positive potentials.  This shows that the photoelectrons are emitted from plate A with a finite velocity.  If the negative potential is further increased, the photo current decreases and finally becomes zero at a particular value.  The negative potential of plate B at which the photo current becomes zero is called the <a href="19.html">stopping potential</a> (fig. 1.9).<br /><br />

						<strong>b.	The effect of intensity of incident radiation:</strong><br /><br />
						The stopping potential is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation, and the saturation current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiation.<br /><br />
						<strong>c.	The effect of frequency of incident radiation:</strong><br>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<img src="Fig1.10.png" height="185px"><br>
						Figure 1.10 shows the variation of stopping potential with the frequency of incident light by keeping the same emitting surface and same intensity of incident radiation. The graph shows that at frequency ν<sub>0</sub>, the stopping potential is zero. Hence the frequency ν<sub>0</sub> is called the threshold frequency and the photoelectric effect occurs above this frequency.<br /><br />
						Thus, the <a href="15.html">threshold frequency</a> is defined as the minimum frequency of the incident radiation which can cause photoelectric emission.<br /><br />
						<strong>d. The effect of photomental:</strong><br /><br />
						The threshold frequency is a function of photometal; it depends on the nature of the photometal.<br /><br />

						&emsp;&nbsp;1)	A part of its energy, called photoelectric work function (𝑊<sub>0</sub>), is used just to free<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the electron from the atom and away from the metal surface.<br>
						&emsp;&nbsp;2)	The other part of energy, called kinetic energy (1/2 𝑚𝑣<sup>2</sup>) is used to move the electron.<br /><br />

						where, v is the velocity of the emitted electron and Equation 1 is known as Einstein’s Photoelectric equation<br /><br />
						When the photon’s energy is of such a value that it can only liberate the electron from the metal surface, then the kinetic energy of the electron is zero. Therefore, Equation 1 now becomes:<br /><br />

						<strong class="head3">1.3.5 Dual nature of matter (particles)</strong><br /><br />
						&emsp;&emsp;It is well known that light exhibits the phenomenon of interference, diffraction, polarization, photoelectric effect, Compton effect and discrete emission and absorption.  Among these phenomena, interference, diffraction, and polarization are explained based on wave theory of light.  Hence, these phenomena show that light possesses wave nature.  On the other hand, phenomena like photoelectric effect, Compton effect and discrete emission and absorption can only be explained based on quantum theory of light.  According to quantum theory, light is propagated in small packets of energy hv which are called photons.  So, the latter phenomena indicates that light possesses particle (Corpuscules) nature.  Thus, one can say that light possesses a dual nature. i.e., in some experiments, light behaves like waves while in other experiments it behaves like particles.<br /><br />
						&emsp;&emsp;In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that the idea of dual nature should also be extended to matter (i.e., to all particles such as electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms, molecules etc.).  Until 1923, matter was considered as completely particle in nature; but in that year Louis de Broglie proposed that, a material particle (such as electron) might have a dual nature, just as light does.<br /><br />
						&emsp;&emsp;Based on the following concepts, de Broglie proposed the idea of <a href="21.html">dual nature of matter</a>. <br /><br />
						&nbsp;&emsp;1.	The universe consists of radiation and matter.<br /><br />
						&nbsp;&emsp;2.	Nature is symmetrical everywhere.  If radiation possesses dual nature, then the matter<br>&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should also possess dual nature.<br /><br />
						<strong class="head3">1.3.6 De Broglie wave </strong><br /><br />
						According to de Broglie, matter has a dual nature like light.  All matter particles like electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms, and molecules have a wave associated with them, which is called <a href="20.html">matter wave or de Broglie wave</a>.
